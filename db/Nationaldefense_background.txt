Torture has been used for thousands of years (ex: The Spanish Inquisitions, Salem Witch trails...) People will say almost anything to stop the torture. This results in false confessions but also sometimes true confessions. Most of the time the torture victim will not confess but will name names. Believable lies are usually based somewhere in reality, so enemies, acquaintances,friends and relatives often get reliable by itself, but may generate leads for further investigation. Other interrogation tools that are tailored to the specific psychology of the captive are much more reliable and often get real results where torture does not.

Torture of enemy solders and civilians was outlawed by the Geneva convention of 1929. With the invention of photography and modern horrible weapons of war (including gas), people tired of war atrocities. Also viscous attacks tended to create tit for tat reactions. Eye for an eye, often escalates out of control.

Pre WWII, the Japanese mistreatment of Chinese prisoners was used as a motivation to put embargo's on the Japanese which eventually led to their attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese mistreatment of American prisoners was used to motivate American citizens to volunteer, donate to the cause and fight harder. It was also used as one of the justifications for using the atomic bomb. After the war, this mistreatment was used to convict the Japanese for war crimes.
